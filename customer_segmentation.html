									<h2>Customer Groups Information</h2>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Pie chart.svg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> This pie chart indicates that group1 comprises the largest proportion of individuals, with 24.5%, 
										making up nearly a quarter of the total population studied. It suggests a significant portion of customers fall into this category.
										Group 6 and Group 3 are slightly smaller than Group 1, but they are still significant segments of the customer base.
										Group 4  and Group 5 have similar numbers of individuals, They represent around 16% of the population each, 
										indicating their comparable importance within the customer base.Group 2 has the smallest number of individuals comparing with the other 5 groups.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p><strong>Check the age and income distribution of our customer base</strong></p>
									<div class="image-container">
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/Income.png" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image right"><img src="images/age.png" alt="" /></span>
									</div>
									<p>Despite a few outliers evident in the histograms, an analysis of the two histograms presented above reveals a predominant concentration of our customer base within the age bracket of 30 to 60 years old.
										Specifically, a substantial majority falls within the range of 40 to 50 years old.
										In terms of income distribution, our customer demographic primarily falls within the annual income range of 20,000 to 80,000 USD. 
										Notably, the largest segment of our clientele earns between 40,000 to 60,000 USD annually, with a discernibly smaller proportion exhibiting higher income levels.
